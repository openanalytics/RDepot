Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\n * Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\n * Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\n files (\/etc\/localtime, \/usr\/share\/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\n environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\n format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\n local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\n and Windows registry-based time zones.\n * Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\n Olson's database.\n * Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\n using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\n * A comprehensive test suite.\n \n Quick example\n =============\n Here's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\n package. For more examples, look at the documentation.\n \n Suppose you want to know how much time is left, in\n years\/months\/days\/etc, before the next easter happening on a\n year with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\n date out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here is the code:\n \n .. code-block:: python3\n \n >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n >>> from datetime import *\n >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n >>> today = now.date()\n >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n Today is: 2003-10-11\n >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n \n Being exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n \n Contributing\n ============\n \n We welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes). For more information about how to contribute to the project, see the ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file in the repository.\n \n \n Author\n ======\n The dateutil module was written by Gustavo Niemeyer <gustavo@niemeyer.net>\n in 2003.\n \n It is maintained by:\n \n * Gustavo Niemeyer <gustavo@niemeyer.net> 2003-2011\n * Tomi Pieviläinen <tomi.pievilainen@iki.fi> 2012-2014\n * Yaron de Leeuw <me@jarondl.net> 2014-2016\n * Paul Ganssle <paul@ganssle.io> 2015-\n \n Starting with version 2.4.1, all source and binary distributions will be signed\n by a PGP key that has, at the very least, been signed by the key which made the\n previous release.

I'm sure\n this is what you were all worrying about most.\n \n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.\n - Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.\n - Updated bundled idna to v2.5.\n - Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.\n \n 2.13.0 (2017-01-24)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Features**\n \n - Only load the ``idna`` library when we've determined we need it. This will\n save some memory for users.\n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.\n - Updated bundled idna to 2.2.\n \n 2.12.5 (2017-01-18)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting\n big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.\n \n 2.12.4 (2016-12-14)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the\n basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,\n the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.\n \n 2.12.3 (2016-12-01)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with \"http\".\n These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed\n URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an\n overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This\n change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to\n be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.\n \n 2.12.2 (2016-11-30)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but\n which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if\n it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will\n be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using\n IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid\n but still common hostnames.\n - Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise\n ``InvalidSchema`` errors.\n - Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still\n have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.\n - Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.\n - Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a\n Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an\n ``AttributeError``.\n \n 2.12.1 (2016-11-16)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Updated setuptools 'security' extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.\n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.\n \n 2.12.0 (2016-11-15)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Improvements**\n \n - Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.\n This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory\n for .de domains.\n - Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no\n longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.\n - Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for\n ``PreparedRequest`` objects.\n - Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but\n do have a ``seek`` method.\n - Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary\n by the ``data=`` keyword argument.\n - Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than\n stripping the credentials.\n - If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is\n redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to\n rewind the body object so it can be replayed.\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated\n through to non-urllib3 backends.\n - Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred\n over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.\n - Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling\n back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.\n - Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when\n using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native\n string type for the platform.\n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.\n - Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.\n \n 2.11.1 (2016-08-17)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for\n streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in\n 2.11.\n - Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when\n following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST\/PUT to GET.\n \n 2.11.0 (2016-08-08)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Improvements**\n \n - Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.\n - Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to\n reduce risk of header smuggling.\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that\n occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.\n - Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``\n environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.\n - Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure\n OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).\n - Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and\n ``None`` for chunk sizes.\n - Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have\n the underlying connection closed but not returned to the connection pool,\n which could cause Requests to hang in situations where the ``HTTPAdapter``\n had been configured to use a blocking connection pool.\n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.\n - Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as acceptable header values. This release does not.\n \n 2.10.0 (2016-04-29)\n +++++++++++++++++++\n \n **New Features**\n \n - SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks; ``$ pip install requests[socks]``)\n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.\n \n 2.9.2 (2016-04-29)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Improvements**\n \n - Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use OrderedDict\n as its underlying datastore.\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Don't use redirect_cache if allow_redirects=False\n - When passed objects that throw exceptions from ``tell()``, send them via\n chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.\n - Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.\n \n 2.9.1 (2015-12-21)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to send binary\n strings as bodies in Python 3.\n - Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain locales.\n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.\n \n 2.9.0 (2015-12-15)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)\n \n - The ``verify`` keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a\n directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.\n - Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.\n - Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the status code\n registry.\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - For file-like objects that are not seeked to the very beginning, we now\n send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually read, rather\n than the total size of the file, allowing partial file uploads.\n - When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no obvious\n content length we set ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` rather than\n ``Content-Length: 0``.\n - We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading chunked\n bodies.\n - We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python 3, by\n decoding it as UTF-8.\n - Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when using the\n functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the garbage collector to\n clean them up.\n - Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed ``qop`` directive that\n contains no token, by treating it the same as if no ``qop`` directive was\n provided at all.\n - Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by name.\n \n **Miscellaneous**\n \n - Updated urllib3 to 1.13.\n \n 2.8.1 (2015-10-13)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Update certificate bundle to match ``certifi`` 2015.9.6.2's weak certificate\n bundle.\n - Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ``ConnectTimeout`` instead of\n ``ConnectionError``\n - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly respect the\n ``json`` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.\n - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a\n Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.\n \n 2.8.0 (2015-10-05)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)\n \n - Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the ``proxies``\n dictionary to have entries of the form\n ``{'<scheme>:\/\/<hostname>': '<proxy>'}``. Host-specific proxies will be used\n in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the\n previous syntax will continue to work.\n - ``Response.raise_for_status`` now prints the URL that failed as part of the\n exception message.\n - ``requests.utils.get_netrc_auth`` now takes an ``raise_errors`` kwarg,\n defaulting to ``False``. When ``True``, errors parsing ``.netrc`` files cause\n exceptions to be thrown.\n - Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to unbundle\n requests downstream.\n - Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on Linux: now\n contains only the requests version.\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - The ``json`` parameter to ``post()`` and friends will now only be used if\n neither ``data`` nor ``files`` are present, consistent with the\n documentation.\n - We now ignore empty fields in the ``NO_PROXY`` environment variable.\n - Fixed problem where ``httplib.BadStatusLine`` would get raised if combining\n ``stream=True`` with ``contextlib.closing``.\n - Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection back to\n the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.\n - Miscellaneous minor internal changes.\n - Digest Auth support is now thread safe.\n \n **Updates**\n \n - Updated urllib3 to 1.12.\n \n 2.7.0 (2015-05-03)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n This is the first release that follows our new release process. For more, see\n `our documentation\n <http:\/\/docs.python-requests.org\/en\/latest\/community\/release-process\/>`_.\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer\n encoding and response framing.\n \n 2.6.2 (2015-04-23)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not\n properly decompressed. (#2561)\n \n 2.6.1 (2015-04-22)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.\n \n - Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the user to\n pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f. #2552)\n \n - Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to\n the adapter. (#2503)\n \n - Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL that\n cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)\n \n - Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest\n Authentication.

(#2527)\n \n 2.6.0 (2015-03-14)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie\n without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL\n exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie\n stealing. This was disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of\n `BugFuzz <https:\/\/bugfuzz.com>`_. This affects all versions of requests from\n v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).\n \n - Fix error when requests is an ``install_requires`` dependency and ``python\n setup.py test`` is run. (#2462)\n \n - Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the\n vendored import location.\n \n - Include fixes to ``urllib3``'s header handling.\n \n - Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.\n \n **Features and Improvements**\n \n - Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ``files`` argument.\n (#2468)\n \n - Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ``str``, ``bytes``, or\n ``bytearray`` input to the ``files`` argument.\n \n 2.5.3 (2015-02-24)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see\n (#2455, #2456, and http:\/\/bugs.python.org\/issue23476)\n \n 2.5.2 (2015-02-23)\n ++++++++++++++++++\n \n **Features and Improvements**\n \n - Add sha256 fingerprint support. (`shazow\/urllib3#540`_)\n \n - Improve the performance of headers. (`shazow\/urllib3#544`_)\n \n **Bugfixes**\n \n - Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove\n requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those\n same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party\n libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having\n to fallback to the system urllib3.\n \n - Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then quoting\n fails. (#2356)\n \n - Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (#2411)\n \n - Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest authentication\n challenges provides both auth and auth-int qop-values. (#2408)\n \n - Fix a socket leak.
