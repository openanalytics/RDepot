Tests can then be run after installation with:\n \n python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test()'\n \n Code of Conduct\n ----------------------\n \n NumPy is a community-driven open source project developed by a diverse group of\n [contributors](https:\/\/numpy.org\/teams\/). The NumPy leadership has made a strong\n commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the\n [NumPy Code of Conduct](https:\/\/numpy.org\/code-of-conduct\/) for guidance on how to interact\n with others in a way that makes our community thrive.\n \n Call for Contributions\n ----------------------\n \n The NumPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!\n \n Small improvements or fixes are always appreciated. If you are considering larger contributions\n to the source code, please contact us through the [mailing\n list](https:\/\/mail.python.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/numpy-discussion) first.\n \n Writing code isn\u2019t the only way to contribute to NumPy. You can also:\n - review pull requests\n - help us stay on top of new and old issues\n - develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials\n - maintain and improve [our website](https:\/\/github.com\/numpy\/numpy.org)\n - develop graphic design for our brand assets and promotional materials\n - translate website content\n - help with outreach and onboard new contributors\n - write grant proposals and help with other fundraising efforts\n \n For more information about the ways you can contribute to NumPy, visit [our website](https:\/\/numpy.org\/contribute\/). \n If you\u2019re unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, reach out! You can\n ask on the mailing list or here, on GitHub, by opening a new issue or leaving a\n comment on a relevant issue that is already open.\n \n Our preferred channels of communication are all public, but if you\u2019d like to\n speak to us in private first, contact our community coordinators at\n numpy-team@googlegroups.com or on Slack (write numpy-team@googlegroups.com for\n an invitation).\n \n We also have a biweekly community call, details of which are announced on the\n mailing list. You are very welcome to join.\n \n If you are new to contributing to open source, [this\n guide](https:\/\/opensource.guide\/how-to-contribute\/) helps explain why, what,\n and how to successfully get involved.\n \n",

Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\n * Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\n * Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\n files (\/etc\/localtime, \/usr\/share\/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\n environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\n format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\n local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\n and Windows registry-based time zones.\n * Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\n Olson's database.\n * Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\n using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\n * A comprehensive test suite.\n \n Quick example\n =============\n Here's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\n package. For more examples, look at the documentation.\n \n Suppose you want to know how much time is left, in\n years\/months\/days\/etc, before the next easter happening on a\n year with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\n date out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here is the code:\n \n .. code-block:: python3\n \n >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n >>> from datetime import *\n >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n >>> today = now.date()\n >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n Today is: 2003-10-11\n >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n \n Being exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n \n Contributing\n ============\n \n We welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).
